# YandexGPT-based Jupyter Notebook for summarizing a no-matter-how-long text

This notebook covers the following main Langchain-based approaches to the said task:
- [Stuff](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains#lcel-chains)
- [Map-Reduce](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains#legacy-chains)
- [Refine](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains#legacy-chains)

For examples and details, see the notebook.

The notebook considers all existing options for handling the text summarization task with Langchain, providing detailed comments in Russian and extensive diagrams (with inscriptions in English).

This notebook is likely to be of help when developing custom YandexGPT-based apps for summarizing texts, as well as when delivering workshops.

# Before running the notebook, you need to create a Docker image in Datasphere from the Python 3.9 template.
